# Crime_Data

Analysis of Big Data means bring out some meaningful information from the large amount of data. Here I have done the same. I have taken Chicago Crime Dataset from 2003-16 and analyzed that using R. I found out many meaningful information from the dataset and plot graphs for the same. There are 1048575 records. 

R Libraries used:
plyr,
dplyr,
ggplot2.



Rest of the functions used in the project are all part of base package.
